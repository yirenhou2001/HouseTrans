Description: This package provides a framework for household transmission chain analysis by a streamlined pipeline to simulate household transmission data and to estimate community and within-household infection risks from either synthetic or user-supplied data. The workflow builds person-day tables, impute infection timelines with Gamma-distributed delays, and fits penalized models with optional covariates. Post-processing summarizes mean estimates, uncertainty, bias, and relative bias, Two user functions cover the main tasks: GenSyn() to simulate data and run the full estimation pipeline (with optional summaries), and TransmissionChainAnalysis() to run the same estimation pipeline on user data.
