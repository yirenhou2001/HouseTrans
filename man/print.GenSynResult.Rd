\title{Print a GenSynResult}
\usage{
\method{print}{GenSynResult}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{GenSynResult} object, typically the result of \code{\link{GenSyn}}.}

\item{...}{Passed to or from other methods (unused).}
}
\value{
\code{x}, returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Nicely prints sections available in a \code{GenSynResult} returned by
\code{\link{GenSyn}}. If present, the per-individual data summary and the
post-processing table are shown; otherwise concise guidance is printed.
}
\details{
This S3 method is invoked when a \code{GenSynResult} is printed (e.g., typing
the object at the console or calling \code{print(x)}). The method does not
perform any computation and does not modify global state; it only formats and
prints components that were included in the returned object.
