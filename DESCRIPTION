Description: Tools to simulate and analyze household transmission chains with viral-load dynamics. Generates synthetic household data with role-specific susceptibility and infectivity and optional seasonal forcing, constructs person-day and test-time tables, and estimates community and within-household transmission parameters via Bayesian inference using Stan. Includes utilities to preprocess user-supplied testing data, summarize secondary attack rates and tranmission timelines, and creat diagnostic plots.
